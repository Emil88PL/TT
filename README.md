Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.

I use XAMPP with folder name ToucanTech and Database: members.
You can write Name, Email address and select School from a list.
While choosing School you can see who is in that School.


(You have to create in 127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin database named 'members' and import 'users.php' table.)

Warmest Regards 
Emil Kotlowski
